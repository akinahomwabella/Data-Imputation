# Data-Imputation
Overview
This project combines two main tasks:

Twitter Sentiment Analysis: Using a Kaggle dataset for classification of tweets into various sentiments (e.g., Positive, Negative, Neutral).
Financial Data Imputation: Handling missing data in financial datasets (e.g., Yahoo Finance) using advanced imputation techniques and evaluating the impact on forecasting models.
Contents
twitter_analysis.ipynb: Notebook for analyzing and classifying Twitter sentiment using machine learning models.
financial_imputation.ipynb: Notebook for imputing missing data in financial datasets and testing various forecasting models.
Features
Twitter Sentiment Analysis:
Preprocessing and feature engineering (e.g., sentiment polarity, subjectivity, TF-IDF vectorization).
Model training and evaluation:
Logistic Regression
Random Forest
Neural Networks
Classification metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score.
Financial Data Imputation:
Handling missing values using:

Data
Twitter Sentiment Analysis Dataset:

Source: Kaggle
Description: A dataset containing tweets labeled with sentiments.
Yahoo Finance Dataset:

Source: Yahoo Finance
Description: Financial data for stock prices, with potential gaps to test imputation methods.
Usage
Clone this repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/akinahomwabella/Data-Imputation.git
Open the notebooks:
twitter_analysis.ipynb for sentiment analysis.
